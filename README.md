# Personal Coding Standards

This repository documents the coding standards I use across my personal projects. These guidelines help ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability in codebases. Each project may still have their own coding standards and/or conventions, but this project serves to be a starting point for such standards and conventions.

## General Guidance

In addition to language specific coding styles, the [GeneralGuidelines.md](docs/GeneralGuidelines.md) document also outlines language agnostic guidance that should be followed as much as possible.

## Languages

- [C#](docs/Languages/C-Sharp.md)
- C++ (coming soon)
- [CSS](docs/Languages/CSS.md)
- [HTML](docs/Languages/HTML.md)
- JSON (coming soon)
- [Markdown](docs/Languages/Markdown.md)
- [Razor](docs/Languages/Razor.md) (`.razor` files)
- Rust (coming soon)
- Sass (coming soon)
- Typescript (coming soon)
- XML (coming soon)

## Usage

Refer to the relevant language section for best practices, naming conventions, formatting rules, and other recommendations. These standards are advisory and intended for my own personal projects, but may be useful for others seeking inspiration.

## Contributing

This repository isn't currently taking pull requests as this is outside the scope of this repository's intended purpose (this is more of a general template for my personal projects' coding standards).
